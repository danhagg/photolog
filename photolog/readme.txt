A. How to Use Photolog

1. From File Menu > Drag n Drop individual images
2. Drag the images from the folder to workspace.
3. Close folder
4. Move images Up and down to reorder with "Up" and "Down" buuttons
5. Delete an image with "DELETE" button
6. The image size for the selected image is displayed in the Img (MB) box. This box turns red if an image is above 2 MB in size. Building Word documents with large images will slow down the performance of Microsft Word. You may wish to chose a smaller image.
7. Double-click an image to see it enlarged
8. The caption length is displayed in the "caption" box.
9. The last 4 characters of the image filename are displayed on the image (but NOT in the Word document)
10. Caption length is forced to be below 220 characters as the Word document will not format to two images per page otherwise.
11. DO NOT number captions. Photolog will do this automatically.
12. Number of images in workspace displaye in "# Imgs" box
13. "Publish" button will autogenerate a word document with captions.
14. File > Save current project. Will save a .XML file of current progress. Can be saved anywhere. Maybe keep it in your images folder.
15. File > Resume project. Select the XML file you saved earlier.






B. Simple guide on how Photolog_Desktop works

This software works by using pointers to your filesystem. 
When you save a project, a simple file is made (.xml) that tells Photolog_Desktop where all the images you are saving are located on your drive.
When you resume a project, Photolog_Desktop uses the xml file to look in those locations. 
If you moved them between saving and resuming your project then u will have issues.
